Welcome to my personal website. I’m a robotics researcher and engineer passionate about bridging theory and practice in intelligent systems, with a focus on grasp planning, underwater vehicles, and human-robot interaction. This site showcases my research, teaching, projects, and thoughts across the intersections of robotics, machine learning, and systems design.

About Me
======
I work at the intersection of robotics with AI, mechanical engineering, and control systems. My recent work involves developing grasp planning strategies for a 3-finger adaptive gripper, combining deep learning with PyBullet-based simulation for validation. I’ve also contributed to autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) control systems using ROS2 and Gazebo, and actively engage in both academic writing and technical leadership. My background includes experience with the UR5e arm, Robotiq grippers, Intel RealSense cameras, MoveIt, and self-balancing robots. Beyond research, I enjoy mentoring, teaching, and exploring applications of VLMs and LLMs in robotics.

Outside of work, I’m an avid book reader and love expressing myself through sketching and painting. I also enjoy watching all kinds of movies and series—from classics to the latest binge-worthy shows.
