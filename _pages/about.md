Hello! I'm Shreyash, a robotics engineer and a recent graduate of the M.S. program at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras. I am passionate about building intelligent systems that can perceive, understand, and interact with the world around them. My work focuses on the exciting intersection of mechanical design, software development, and artificial intelligence, with projects ranging from autonomous navigation to robotic grasping and industrial automation.
My academic and professional journey has been a deep dive into the world of robotics, from programming manipulators like the UR5e to developing deep learning models for computer vision. I'm particularly proud of my work on a semi-autonomous system for recycling lithium-ion batteries, a project that combined human-robot collaboration with a focus on sustainability.
When I'm not engineering a solution, I'm likely exploring my other passions. I have a deep appreciation for mathematics and enjoy expressing my creative side through painting and sketching. I'm also an avid reader of philosophy, a movie and series enthusiast, and a keen volleyball player. I believe that this blend of analytical thinking and creative pursuits is what fuels my innovative approach to robotics
